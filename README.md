# AST-Rule-Engine
This project implements a rule engine based on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It allows for the evaluation of complex rules and conditions by building and traversing an AST. The engine supports logical and arithmetic operations, enabling dynamic evaluation of rules during runtime.
